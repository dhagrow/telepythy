The bottom-right of the UI displays your connection status to the currently selected profile. Click the button at the bottom-right to select a different profile. You can also use the "Profiles" menu.

You can move the source editor around if you first enable the "Source Titlebar" in the "View" menu.

A profile can be selected on startup using the `--profile` command-line option. You can get a list of all profiles using `--list-profiles`.

The Telepythy service has no dependencies and supports Python 2.7+.

Start a remote service using `pip install telepythy-service`, then run the `telepythy-svc` command. Use `-h` for help and `-v`, or `-vv` for verbose output.

Save a copy of `telepythy_service.pyz`, and copy it anywhere. It can be run directly using `python telepythy_service.pyz`.

`Enter` or `Ctrl+Return` always executes your code. `Return` will only execute your code if there is only one line. You can prevent execution for one line of code by adding a `space` to the end of of the line.
